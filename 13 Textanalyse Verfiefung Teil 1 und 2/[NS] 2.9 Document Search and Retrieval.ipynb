    "LangChain ist ein Framework, das die Entwicklung von Anwendungen erleichtert, die von großen Sprachmodellen angetrieben werden. Es ermöglicht die Verbindung von Sprachmodellen mit anderen Datenquellen und die Interaktion mit der Umgebung, um komplexere Anwendungen zu erstellen. LangChain bietet auch eine spezielle Funktion namens \"Chains\" für logische Verbindungen zwischen mehreren Sprachmodellen, und ist ein modulares Framework für Python und JavaScript. Es wird für Anwendungen wie Dokumentenanalyse, Chatbots und Code-Analyse verwendet.\n",

    "Allzweck-Sprachmodelle können feinabgestimmt werden, um mehrere allgemeine Aufgaben zu erfüllen, wie z. B. Stimmungsanalyse und Erkennung benannter Entitäten. Diese Aufgaben erfordern in der Regel kein zusätzliches Hintergrundwissen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Für komplexere und wissensintensivere Aufgaben ist es möglich, ein sprachmodellbasiertes System aufzubauen, das zur Erledigung von Aufgaben auf externe Wissensquellen zugreift. Dies ermöglicht eine größere sachliche Konsistenz, verbessert die Zuverlässigkeit der generierten Antworten und trägt dazu bei, das Problem der „Halluzination“ zu mildern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meta-KI-Forscher haben eine Methode namens Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) eingeführt, um solche wissensintensiven Aufgaben zu bewältigen. RAG kombiniert eine Information-Retrieval-Komponente mit einem Textgeneratormodell. RAG kann fein abgestimmt werden und sein internes Wissen kann auf effiziente Weise und ohne eine Neuschulung des gesamten Modells geändert werden.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG nimmt eine Eingabe entgegen und ruft anhand einer Quelle (z. B. Wikipedia) eine Reihe relevanter/unterstützender Dokumente ab. Die Dokumente werden als Kontext mit der ursprünglichen Eingabeaufforderung verkettet und dem Textgenerator zugeführt, der die endgültige Ausgabe erzeugt. Dies macht RAG anpassungsfähig für Situationen, in denen sich Fakten im Laufe der Zeit ändern könnten. Dies ist sehr nützlich, da das parametrische Wissen von LLMs statisch ist. RAG ermöglicht es Sprachmodellen, eine erneute Schulung zu umgehen und ermöglicht so den Zugriff auf die neuesten Informationen zur Generierung zuverlässiger Ausgaben durch abrufbasierte Generierung.\n",

At the heart of our efforts is one idea vindicated by 25 straight months of economic growth : Freedom and incentives unleash the drive and entrepreneurial genius that are the core of human progress . We have begun to increase the rewards for work , savings , and investment ; reduce the increase in the cost and size of government and its interference in people ' s lives .

Nature still offers her bounty and human efforts have multiplied it . Plenty is at our doorstep , but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply .

Practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion , rejected by the hearts and minds of men . True they have tried , but their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition . Faced by failure of credit they have proposed only the lending of more money .

Now every avenue of production is crowded with activity , labor is well employed , and American products find good markets at home and abroad . Our diversified productions , however , are increasing in such unprecedented volume as to admonish us of the necessity of still further enlarging our foreign markets by broader commercial relations .
